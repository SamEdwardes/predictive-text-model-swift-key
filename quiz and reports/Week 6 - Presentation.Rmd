## Background

As part of the JHU/Coursera Data Science course we are required to build a text prediction model. The objective of the model is to predict the next word that you wish to type.

## How the model works {.smaller}

The model was developed using data from twitter, blogs, and news sites. The model is based off of the so called "Stupid Back-off model", which predicts the next word by finding a similar history of words, and then selecting the word which is most common based on the previous history. For example:

- *"What do you think of president"* may be typed into the search box
- The model will look at the 3 most recent words, in this case: *"think of president"*
- It will then search the training data for any time these three words have occurred in a row
- It will then suggest what ever the top 3 most common preceding words are
- If the model is not able to find those three words ever occurring, it will back of and search for *"of president"*, if no matches are found it will further back-off and search for *"president"*


## Model accuracy

The model was tested on 1,000 test cases. The model was able to obtain an accuracy rate of 20% based on one of the top 3 predictions being correct.
```{r warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
setwd("C:/Users/sedwardes/Documents/GitHub/predictive-text-model-swift-key/app")
test.result.df <- fread("data/test.result.df.csv")

ggplot(data = test.result.df, aes(x = "", y = correct, fill = correct)) +
    geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
    coord_polar("y", start = 0)
```


## Other considerations

**Additional Notes**

- The model was tested by keeping stop words and removing stop words. In the end, a decision was made to keep stop words as it improved overall model accuracy. However by keeping stop-words it was noted the model was often less "useful", it it would predict high percentage stop words.
